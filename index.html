      <h1>About <span>Me</span></h1>
      <p>My name is Mahmoud Hammad, I have a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Palestine University.
        I worked in several companies as a site engineer, but I did not find that this field is the field that I dreamed of.
        So I started looking for my dream of becoming a professional programmer, then I started learning from YouTube channels and programming education sites, in addition to my search for a work environment that would help me learn until I found a GSG code acadmy, where I decided to enroll in it, and fortunately I was accepted into the Code Academy - Coding Foundation.</p>
